I am a passionate computer engineer with a strong background in programming, mathematics, and artificial intelligence. My love for games since adolescence and admiration for game developers have inspired me to pursue a career in game development and design. Over the years, I’ve worked on various projects that showcase my technical skills, creativity, and problem-solving abilities.

## Academic Background
I hold a **Bachelor’s degree in Computer Engineering**, during which I gained extensive experience in programming and AI. My coursework and projects included developing interactive applications, implementing AI-based solutions, and delving into game environments. My **bachelor’s thesis** focused on artificial intelligence, providing me with a solid foundation for pursuing advanced studies in game development.

As a teaching assistant for **Advanced Programming** and **Computational Intelligence**, I graded assignments, conducted Q&A sessions, and created projects that challenged students to think critically and solve complex problems. I particularly enjoyed guiding students in building graphical and interactive projects, such as implementing **Clash Royale** in JavaFX.

## Professional Interests
I am currently exploring opportunities to combine my programming expertise with my passion for games by pursuing a master’s degree related to **game development and design**. I aim to deepen my understanding of game design principles and AI in games while connecting with experts in the field. My ultimate goal is to contribute to innovative and engaging games that leave a lasting impression on players.

## Extracurricular Activities
I am an active participant in the tech and gaming community. As a member of my university's **Students' Scientific Chapter**, I organized and participated in events such as **AUT GameCraft**, which included workshops, talks, and game jams. During my tenure as president, I successfully organized the third GameCraft, a highlight of my extracurricular journey. These experiences helped me expand my network, develop game projects using Unity, and hone my event management skills.

## Projects and Achievements
- **Sea Battle (Python)**: An OOP-based project designed to teach advanced programming concepts.
- **Flappy Bird (Pygame)**: A fun and engaging project to introduce students to game development.
- **Clash Royale (JavaFX)**: A comprehensive implementation as a final project for Advanced Programming.
- **AI-Powered Solutions**: Worked on projects and assignments integrating AI concepts into practical applications.
